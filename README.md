# UrbanRural_ImageClassification

## Abstract 
This project focuses on binary classification of natural versus built environments using advanced machine learning techniques. The methods employed include a comprehensive workflow starting with data ingestion, feature analysis using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection. The dataset was expanded to reduce overfitting, and images were pre-processed with data augmentation techniques. The core methods involve training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet50 and Vision Transformers to improve classification performance. LIME was used to interpret which image features most influenced model decisions, while YOLO was applied to analyze object composition in both natural and urban datasets. The analysis reveals that ResNet50, a pretrained CNN, consistently outperforms other models in accuracy, and the paper concludes by evaluating its performance against alternatives like Vision Transformers.
